### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyemets/insta-save-telegram-bot.git
   cd instagram-story-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your bot token**
   Create a file named `tg_token.py`:
   ```python
   TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📋 Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies:

```
aiogram==2.25.1
aiohttp==3.8.5
selenium==4.15.0
webdriver-manager==4.0.1
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables instead of `tg_token.py`:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
```

### Bot Settings

The bot automatically creates a `user_settings.json` file to store user preferences:

```json
{
  "user_id": {
    "auto_enabled": false,
    "interval": 3,
    "last_check": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "target_username": "example_user"
  }
}
```
